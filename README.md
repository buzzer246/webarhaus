Dear Sir/Madam

Checked Top 3 Luxury Home Decor brand websites

1. Roche Bobois
Website: https://www.roche-bobois.com/en-IN/

2. Fendi Casa
Website: https://www.fendicasa.com/en/

3. Arhaus
Website: https://www.arhaus.com/

Note: The First Two websites are Okay, I found 3rd Website is Delay in Load Time and 
there is no Perfect Attraction for Customers, when client Landed over the Homepage he should 
view the site in 4Sec and then client has to sits in 2 mins then we can come to Jurdge our websites are good enough we achieve.

Lets see dive into code now...

For this I have used Reactjs,Bootstrap,Shards-UI and Font-Awesome Icons.
